          How long do we keep your personal information for?

        <p className='mb-4'>
          We apply different retention policies for different types of personal
          information. The retention period is dictated by certain factors, such
          as the type of personal information, the purpose for which the data
          was collected, the legal basis permitting us to collect and store it,
          statutory requirements, industry guidelines, our legitimate interests
          in providing the Services or protecting our legal rights etc.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          We continuously assess the retention periods in order to ensure that
          we do not keep your personal information more than is absolutely
          necessary for processing purposes. When we no longer have a legitimate
          reason or legal requirement to process your personal information, we
          will delete it or store it in an anonymized and aggregated manner that
          no longer identifies you.

          For example, if you close your account with us, we may retain in our
          files certain information associated with your account and past
          transactions for purposes of backups, fraud prevention, dispute
          resolution, investigations, and compliance with legal requirements.
